Replace the lexical rules of the KPL language with the following rules:
Identifiers:
* A valid identifier can have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits, the dollar sign ($) and the underscore (_)
* 1.The first letter of an identifier should be either a letter or an underscore.
* 2.You cannot use keywords as identifiers.( Base code also have it because if it is keyword => return keyword so there is no chance to be indent)
* 3.Length of an identì?er is not over than 15. 
* 4.Identifiers are case-sensitive
Keywords:
* Keywords are case-insensitive (Base code already have this case)
Comments:
* Multi-line Comments :  between /* and */
Special Symbols:
* Relop: not equal to <>
Character/String constants:
Use an addition character \ for 2 constants single quote and backslash, that is ‘\’’ for a single quote and ‘\\’for backslash.
